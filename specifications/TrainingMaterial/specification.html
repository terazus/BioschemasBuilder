description: "The Life Science Training Materials specification provides a way to\
  \ describe bioscience training material on the World Wide Web. It defines a set\
  \ of metadata and vocabularies, built on top of existing technologies and standards,\
  \ that can be used to represent events in Web pages and applications. The goal of\
  \ the specification is to make it easier to discover, exchange and integrate life\
  \ science training material information across the Internet. \n"
