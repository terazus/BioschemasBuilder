  name: additionalType
  parent: Thing
  sdo_desc: An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific
    types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between
    something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use
    the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org
    tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined
    externally.

    GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing

- bsc_dec: Bioschemas usage.  Additional to the use of name and description to describe
    this property in a human-readable way, additionalType should be used to specify
    the nature of the property/relation. For instance, if the property refers to a
    gene/protein disease association, you could use http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000983
    as additionalType for the additionalProperty.  Controlled vocabularies should
    be used whenever possible.

    designed to use specific schema.org properties (e.g. http://schema.org/width,

    location can be refer to a position in a chromosome or sequence or to a physical
    place where, for instance, a sample is stored. Using additionalType is advised
    to make the distinction. For instance, FALDO can be used for sequence coordinates.

    image property for that) or the main web page/record (use mainEntityOfPage for
    that, and see background notes, http://schema.org/docs/datamodel.html#mainEntityBackground,
    for sameAs and url).  Bioschemas usage.  This property could be used, for instance,
    to register a sequence protein as it is a representation of the protein. If you
    want to better define the nature of the representation, use a PropertyValue as
    described in additionalProperty.
