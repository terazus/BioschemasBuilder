description: "This document covers the schema.org and bioschemas.org properties necessary\
  \ to describe data repositories, catalogues and databases in the life sciences,\
  \ organised by their requirement level (M for mandatory, R for recommended and O\
  \ for optional) and driven by a set of use cases. A simple example in JSON-LD is\
  \ also provided. The majority of these fields already exist in schema.org, others\
  \ are pending. \nNote that this draft will be improved progressively through the\
  \ bioschemas process.\n"
