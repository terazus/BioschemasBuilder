description: 'A PhysicalEntity is any object that exists in the physical world and
  cannot be better represented with any other existing type in schema.org. In order
  to specify the nature of this physical entity, additionalProperty must be used to
  specify the nature/type of this physical entity. For instance, http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_010043
  can be used to refer to a protein.


  Bioschemas usage


  A PhysicalEntity is a flexible and extensible wrapper for Life Sciences entities.
  Representations of physical entities in Life Sciences are usually recorded in datasets;
  the link to a dataset should be done via properties. A particular Life Sciences
  entity, refer to as a profile in Bioschemas, will customize PhysicalEntity by modifying
  the marginality, cardinality and ontologies used. For instance, a protein profile
  would recommend pointing to an organism a part of the minimum information, but not
  necessarily to a sample or disease.'

  sdo_desc: An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific
    types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between
    something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use
    the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org
    tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined
    externally.

    entitity, e.g. a product feature or another characteristic for which there is
    no matching property in schema.org.  Note: Publishers should be aware that applications
    designed to use specific schema.org properties (e.g. http://schema.org/width,
    http://schema.org/color, http://schema.org/gtin13, ...) will typically expect
    such data to be provided using those properties, rather than using the generic
    property/value mechanism.  Bioschemas usage.  Additional to the use of name and
    description to describe this property in a human-readable way, additionalType
    should be used to specify the nature of the property/relation. For instance, if
    the property refers to a gene/protein disease association, you could use http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000983
    as additionalType for the additionalProperty.'

  sdo_desc: The location of for example where the event is happening, an organization
    is located, or where an action takes place.  Bioschemas usage.  In Bioschemas
    location can be refer to a position in a chromosome or sequence or to a physical
    place where, for instance, a sample is stored. Using additionalType is advised
    to make the distinction. For instance, FALDO can be used for sequence coordinates.

  sdo_desc: A representation for this entity other than, for instance, an image (used
    image property for that) or the main web page/record (use mainEntityOfPage for
    that, and see background notes, http://schema.org/docs/datamodel.html#mainEntityBackground,
    for sameAs and url).  Bioschemas usage.  This property could be used, for instance,
    to register a sequence protein as it is a representation of the protein. If you
    want to better define the nature of the representation, use a PropertyValue as
    described in additionalProperty.
