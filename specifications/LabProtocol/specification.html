description: 'An experimental protocol is a sequence of tasks and operations executed
  to perform experimental research in biological and biomedical areas.

  Experimental protocols are fundamental information structures that support the description
  of the processes by means of which results are generated in experimental research
  [1]. Experimental protocols describe how the data were produced, the steps undertaken
  and conditions under which these steps were carried out.

  sdo_desc: An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific
    types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between
    something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use
    the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org
    tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined
    externally.

    GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org provides dedicated properties for representing
    many of these, either as textual strings or as URL (URI) links. See <a href="/docs/datamodel.html#identifierBg">background

  sdo_desc: 'Proposal: Add this property to CreativeWork.  A structural element refers
    to qualified text in a CreativeWork. It should be used when plain text is not
    enough, for instance, to distinguish abstract, sections or paragraphs. Qualification
    is achieved by using the additionaType property which should point to an ontological
    term describing the element referred to by this property. The text itself can
    be added using the property text.  Bioschemas usage.  A particular case in Bioschemas
    is LabProtocol where structural elements are used to described advantages (situations
    the Protocol has been successfully employed), limitations (situations the Protocol
    would be unreliable or otherwise unsuccessful), applications (Applications of
    the protocol list the full diversity of the applications of the method and support
    if is possible to extend the range of applications of the protocol. e.g. northern
    blot assays, sequencing, etc.), and outcomes (outcome or expected result by a
    protocol execution).  For LabProtocol, in the applicationType, please use http://purl.org/net/SMARTprotocol#AdvantageOfTheProtocol
    for advantages, http://purl.org/net/SMARTprotocol#LimitationOfTheProtocol for
    limitations, http://purl.org/net/SMARTprotocol#ApplicationOfTheProtocol for applicability,
