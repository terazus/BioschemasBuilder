description: "A Record acts itself as a dataset although it refers to what could be\
  \ seen as the minimum compact, complete and auto-descriptive unit in a dataset,\
  \ i.e., a record.\n\nBioschemas usage\n\nIn Life Sciences, records will represent\
  \ a PhysicalEntity. A link to the represented physical entity should be done via\
  \ \u201Crepresents\u201D property. "

  sdo_desc: An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more specific
    types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is a relationship between
    something and a class that the thing is in. In RDFa syntax, it is better to use
    the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof' attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org
    tools may have only weaker understanding of extra types, in particular those defined
    externally.

    designed to use specific schema.org properties (e.g. http://schema.org/width,
    http://schema.org/color, http://schema.org/gtin13, ...) will typically expect
    such data to be provided using those properties, rather than using the generic
    property/value mechanism.  Bioschemas usage.  Additional to the use of name and
    description to describe this property in a human-readable way, additionalType
    should be used to specify the nature of the property/relation. For instance, if
    the property refers to a gene/protein disease association, you could use http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000983
    as additionalType for the additionalProperty.'
